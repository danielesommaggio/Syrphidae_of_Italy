# `panels/_gbifShared/`

Shared helpers for the GBIF panels. `_`-prefixed, no `main.js`, so the panel
loader ignores it — panels pull pieces in with plain relative imports.

Consumers: `PanelGbifTaxon`, `PanelGbifImages`, `PanelGbifMap`,
`PanelGbifTypeSpecimens`, and `PanelGallery` (its "Type material via GBIF" tab).

## Modules

| File | Exports | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `useGbifMatch.js` | `useGbifMatch(nameRef)` composable · `matchGbifKey(name, {speciesGroupOnly})` · `isSpeciesGroupMatch(match)` · `deriveScientificName` · `recordRequest` · `CHECKLIST_KEY` · `GBIF_TAXON_BASE` / `GBIF_OCCURRENCE_BASE` / `GBIF_OCCURRENCE_DETAIL` · `gbifMenuOptions` | Matches a name against the **CoL** checklist (`v2/species/match`, alphanumeric usage keys). `matchGbifKey` is the one-shot form for looping over a name list (the composable wraps a single ref). |
| `typeStatuses.js` | `TYPE_STATUSES` | 47 GBIF `typeStatus` values, **CamelCase** — the occurrence-search API wants `Holotype`, not the all-caps `HOLOTYPE` from `/enumeration/basic/TypeStatus` (that returns 0 hits). |
| `twSynonymNames.js` | `fetchTwSynonymNames(taxonId)` | TaxonWorks synonym name strings for a taxon-name id (invalidating relationships → subject names). The AssertedDistributions two-step. |
| `gbifTaxonScope.js` | `resolveGbifTaxonScope(primaryName, taxonId, {speciesGroupOnly})` → `{ names, keys }` | The taxon's accepted name **+ every TW synonym** → the name set for filtering and the **union of CoL usage keys** to OR as `taxonKey` params (each synonym may carry its own GBIF records). Every occurrence-based GBIF panel uses this. |
| `gbifBackboneConcept.js` | `fetchGbifBackboneConcept(name)` → `{ acceptedName, synonymNames }` | GBIF **taxonomy-backbone** view: `/v1/species/{intKey}/synonyms` for the accepted taxon — a taxonomy fact, no occurrence sampling. Backbone (integer keys) on purpose: that synonyms route only exists on the backbone. **No longer used by `PanelGbifTaxon`** (as of 2026-08-31 — the backbone and Catalogue of Life agree on lumping for this project's taxa; the old use matched homonyms by bare canonical name, which is what produced the retracted "backbone keeps *Lixus cardui* separate" belief). `PanelGbifMap` still calls it for its density gate. |
| `gbifNameFilter.js` | `canonicalName` · `epithetKey` (genus-independent match key — weevils get recombined a lot) · `shortName` (drop authorship) · `occurrenceName(rec, checklistKey)` · `makeGbifNameFilter(names)` · `partitionByName` / `tallyOccurrenceNames` · `scopeCaption({shown, total, lumpedNames, noun, taxonName, includesSynonyms})` | See **The GBIF synonymy problem**. `tallyOccurrenceNames(rows, names, ck)` → `{ included:{name,count}[], excluded:{name,count}[], keptRows }` — per-name counts split by whether the identified name is in the TW concept (accepted + TW synonyms); `partitionByName` is the thin wrapper (`{kept, lumpedNames}`). `scopeCaption({shown, total, lumpedNames, noun, taxonName, includesSynonyms})` renders the shared caption for the Map / Images panels: pass `match.usage.canonicalName` as `taxonName` (falls back to "this taxon") and `includesSynonyms: names.length > 1` → "identified as *Larinus latus* or a TaxonWorks synonym out of N under GBIF's broader concept, which also includes …". |
| `gbifTypeImages.js` | `gbifOccurrencesToImages(results, {max, names})` | Pure mapper: occurrence-search `results[]` → flat image objects for `ImageLightbox`'s plain-caption path (`figure_label` + `captionHtml` + image-level `attribution`/`source`, `depictions: []`). Also carries `occurrenceKey`, `typeStatus`, `taxonName`, `specimenLabel`, `href` for grouping / direct links. Applies the name filter when `names` is given. |
| `gbif-mark.svg`, `gbif-tokens.css` | — | Logo; `--pp-gbif` brand-green + `--pp-tw` site-blue tokens (`:root` + `.dark`). |

### Concept alignment engine (`PanelGbifTaxon` only)

Pure logic first, IO last. Full design in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-gbif-concept-alignment-design.md`.

| File | Exports | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gbifNameMatch.js` | `matchKey(name, {author})` · `keysMatch(a, b)` · `matchTier(twKey, colKey, {twOriginalCombination, colNameStrings})` · `normalizeSurname` | Pure. `matchKey` = `"epithet|surname|year"` — genus-independent (weevils recombine constantly) but keeps homonyms apart. `keysMatch` tolerates a ±1-year author-date drift. Tiers: **`homotypic`** (original combination lines up on both sides → shared type, ICZN "objective synonym") > **`probable`** (epithet + surname + year agree, ±1 yr, type unconfirmed) > **`weak`** (epithet stem only) > **`none`**. Cite Rees, Franz & Sterner 2026 (doi:10.3897/BDJ.14.e191754); ICZN Art. 53.3 / 57.2–3 / 58 / 61 for the homonymy grading. |
| `conceptRelation.js` | `deriveRelation(Nk, Gk, opts)` · `relationLabel(rel, {twName, colAcceptedName})` | Pure. RCC-5 verdict from two canonical key sets: `congruent ≡`, `included ⊂` (ProperPart), `includes ⊃` (ProperPartInverse), `overlap ><` (PartiallyOverlapping), `none`. Confidence `clear` / `provisional` / `uncertain`; an `AMBIGUOUS_SYNONYM` match status must **not** lower it. Franz & Peet 2009 framing + Fig. 2 icon. |
| `gbifChecklistConcept.js` | `fetchChecklistConcept(canonicalName, twNodes, {checklistKey})` → `{ accepted:{name,alphaKey,intKey}, synonyms, misapplied }` | The Catalogue of Life synonymy. **Two key spaces:** the v2 match and occurrence search use the **alphanumeric** usage key; `/v1/species/{key}/synonyms` needs the **integer** key, obtained from `/v1/species?datasetKey=<CoL UUID>&name=<CANONICAL>`. No ChecklistBank. Splits `MISAPPLIED` names out. Grades each CoL name against the `twNodes` match keys → per-name `matchTier`. Needs the **bare canonical** name; a parenthetical-authorship string returns 0 results. |
| `assembleAlignment.js` | `buildAlignmentModel(input)` → the section 7 model | Pure. `buildCanon` collapses `keysMatch`-equal keys so N / G / facet counts all compare on one key per name. `dedupeByCanon` gives one row per canonical key per zone; the survivor collects the other genus spellings into `otherCombinations`. Four comparison zones + `inDataOnly` + `notComparable`. |
| `gbifConceptAlignment.js` | `resolveConceptAlignment(primaryName, taxonId, opts)` · `fetchTwPlacement(nameString)` | Orchestrator. Memoised per `taxonId\|primaryName`. Fetches the TW name set (accepted node **by id** — `GET /taxon_names/{taxonId}`, so a stored subgenus can't drop the original combination), the CoL synonymy, the occurrence facet + summary counts, then calls `buildAlignmentModel`. `fetchTwPlacement` is the reverse lookup for a `colFoldsIn` name (`/taxon_names?name=` → valid id → `/otus`), cached per name string; `PanelGbifTaxon` fires one per `colFoldsIn` row on load. Also adds `matchGbifRaw` to `useGbifMatch.js`. |

## The GBIF synonymy problem

**GBIF (via its CoL backbone) lumps taxa that TaxonWorks keeps split.** Example
seen in this project: CoL treats **_Lixus cardui_** (Rossi, 1790) as an
`AMBIGUOUS_SYNONYM` of **_Larinus latus_** (Herbst, 1783). TaxonWorks keeps both
as valid species (separate OTUs). GBIF *does* hold occurrence records for the
true _Larinus latus_ **and** the true _Lixus cardui_ — it just files them under
one accepted name.

Consequence: an occurrence-search filtered by `taxonKey` (which includes
synonyms) returns the _Lixus cardui_ lectotype when you query the _Larinus
latus_ key, and vice-versa. Without mitigation, the _Larinus latus_ page shows
"_Lixus cardui_" images / type specimens, and the type-specimen count is
inflated.

**GBIF preserves the original identification** — but not where its docs say.
GBIF's advice ("use the verbatim scientific name filter") is useless here: the
MNHN dataset left `verbatimScientificName` null, so `?verbatimScientificName=…`
returns 0. The distinction lives in the interpreted fields:

| field | _Lixus cardui_ lectotype (occ 583421989) | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `verbatimScientificName` | `null` | raw dataset string, often absent |
| `scientificName` | `Lixus cardui (P.Rossi, 1790)` | **identified name — survives the merge** |
| `acceptedScientificName` | `Larinus latus (J.F.W.Herbst, 1783)` | the lumped name — **never filter on this** |

`occurrenceName(rec, CHECKLIST_KEY)` returns `verbatimScientificName ||
scientificName || classifications[ck].usage.name` — original-most first, and
never `acceptedScientificName`.

**Mitigation — filter results to the TaxonWorks name set.** Build the allowed
set from the TW accepted name **plus that taxon's own TW synonyms**
(`fetchTwSynonymNames`), make a predicate with `makeGbifNameFilter(names)`, and
drop occurrences whose `occurrenceName` isn't in it. `canonicalName` reduces a
name to `"genus epithet"` (lowercase, subgenus/authorship/year stripped) and the
predicate also accepts either-direction infra/supra-specific containment so a
subspecies type of the taxon still passes.

Every occurrence-based panel resolves the scope with `resolveGbifTaxonScope`
(union of CoL keys for the accepted name + all TW synonyms), ORs those as
`taxonKey` params, then keeps only rows whose `occurrenceName` is in the
matching name set.

Two guards on the match, don't confuse them:
- `speciesGroupOnly` — keep only species/subspecies/variety/form. Only the
  **Gallery GBIF tab** uses it (type material is species-group only; the panel
  is already rank-gated on the TW side).
- `rejectHigherRank` — drop **only** `matchType: HIGHERRANK` (name absent from
  CoL → silently upgraded to its genus). A *genuine* genus or family EXACT match
  is kept. Images / TypeSpecimens / Map / Taxon use this so genus and family
  pages still resolve (an earlier `speciesGroupOnly` here made those panels
  vanish entirely).

- **`PanelGallery`** GBIF tab — `gbifOccurrencesToImages(..., { names })`, then
  `new Image()` probe. Type specimens with no loadable image → a direct link
  each. If the auto-selected GBIF tab turns out links-only, the default hands
  off to iNaturalist / TaxonWorks (user can still pick GBIF).
- **`PanelGbifTypeSpecimens`** — one `limit=300` fetch, filter, client-side
  pagination; header count is the filtered count.
- **`PanelGbifImages`** — rebuilt on `/occurrence/search?…&mediaType=StillImage`
  (old `occurrence/experimental/multimedia/species` endpoint 404s everywhere);
  `limit=100`, filter, flatten `media[]`, slice 20.
- **`PanelGbifTaxon`** — rebuilt 2026-08-31 into a **concept alignment** against
  Catalogue of Life (see the next section). Not a Venn any more: a relation
  verdict + a zone table + the Franz and Peet Fig. 2 icon. It still carries an
  exact occurrence summary (one line: "GBIF holds N records (X imaged, Y
  mapped)") from the facet + count calls, and an `inDataOnly` aside for BIN
  placeholders.
- **`PanelGbifMap`** — density-tile mode needs **two** signals to agree, since
  the tiles can't be name-filtered: (a) the 300-record probe has no
  out-of-concept names, **and** (b) `fetchGbifBackboneConcept` shows the
  backbone lists no synonym whose `epithetKey` is outside the TaxonWorks name
  set. Both → GBIF **hex-density tiles** (`/v2/map/occurrence/density`, all
  records, one `taxonKey`). Otherwise → **point markers**, name-filtered, paged
  to 3 × 300 = 900 (`L.circleMarker` via `--pp-gbif`), caption via
  `scopeCaption`. The (b) signal catches a lumped species whose records sort
  past the probe page.
  Basemap defaults to Dark Gray. `PanelGbifTaxon` states the match/mismatch in
  words too.

## The concept alignment model (`PanelGbifTaxon`)

The synonymy filtering above keeps the *occurrence* panels honest. `PanelGbifTaxon`
answers the prior question: **how does the TaxonWorks concept relate to the
Catalogue of Life concept of the same name?** Two layers, kept separate on
purpose (Franz and Thau 2010):

1. **The name graph (fact).** `N` = the TaxonWorks valid name + that OTU's TW
   synonyms. `G` = the Catalogue of Life accepted usage `N`'s valid name maps to
   + that usage's CoL synonyms (minus `MISAPPLIED`). Every name on both sides is
   reduced to a `matchKey` (`epithet|surname|year`, genus-independent), and
   `keysMatch`-equal keys are collapsed so author-date drift does not split a
   name. Each CoL name is graded against `N` at one of three tiers
   (`homotypic` > `probable` > `weak`), `homotypic` meaning the original
   combination lines up on both sides so the names provably share a type.

2. **The relation (inference).** `deriveRelation(Nk, Gk)` reads the two canonical
   key sets and returns one RCC-5 verdict: `≡` congruent, `⊂` included, `⊃`
   includes, `><` overlap, or `none` (no shared key → "cannot be compared").
   Confidence drops to `provisional` when some `N` name could not be checked
   against CoL, and to `uncertain` when only `weak` keys carry the verdict.

The table then sorts every name into four zones: **consensus** (in both), **TW
keeps in** (TW folds it into the page concept, CoL keeps it as its own accepted
species), **CoL folds in** (CoL folds it into the page concept, TW places it
elsewhere), and **misapplied**. Each row carries its own Fig. 2 icon for its own
relation. A `colFoldsIn` row's "TaxonWorks places it under X" entry is resolved
by a reverse lookup (`fetchTwPlacement`, one per row on load) and links to that
concept's OTU page.

**Why Catalogue of Life and not the GBIF backbone:** CoL is the checklist the
sibling panels already query (`CHECKLIST_KEY`), so the alignment matches what
Images / Map / Type specimens actually show. The backbone was tried as a
"second opinion" and cut: for this project's taxa the backbone lumps exactly as
CoL does (the "backbone keeps *Lixus cardui* separate" belief was a homonym
artefact — bare `name=Lixus cardui` matches the accepted *Lixus cardui*
Aurivillius 1921).

**Known limits:** `normalizeSurname` does not expand an abbreviated author
("Woll." vs "Wollaston"), so a genuinely congruent pair can render `none`
"cannot be compared" (conservative, not a wrong verdict). The `twKeepsIn` CoL
cell hardcodes "separate accepted species" with no "(provisional)" suffix.

## Other GBIF gotchas

- **MNHN media (`mediaphoto.mnhn.fr`) is behind a Cloudflare managed challenge** —
  every URL returns 403 to a cross-origin `<img>` (no JS context to solve the
  challenge), in any browser, on any third-party site (gbif.org included). MNHN
  is a major weevil type-image contributor, so many type images simply can't be
  embedded. `PanelGallery` probes each image with `new Image()` and, for type
  specimens with no loadable image, shows a **direct link per record** instead.
- GBIF's image cache (`api.gbif.org/v1/image/cache/...`) needs signed requests;
  there is no usable unsigned proxy.
- `matchType: HIGHERRANK` from `v2/species/match` = the name isn't in the
  checklist and GBIF silently returned its genus. Treat as "no species match".
