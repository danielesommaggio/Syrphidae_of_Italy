      <strong>The Syrphidae of Italy (SoI)</strong> is a collaborative, open-access virtual space created to address the many gaps in our knowledge of hoverflies (family <em>Syrphidae</em>) within the Italian territory. Hoverflies play crucial ecological roles as pollinators, aphid predators, and bioindicators, yet their diversity and distribution in Italy remain poorly documented.

      This project aims to centralize information, facilitate research, and foster community participation. We gather data from field observations, museum collections, taxonomic literature, and citizen science contributions to build a comprehensive and dynamic resource.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ">
      Our goal is to create a living, evolving repository that includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
      <li>Taxonomic and distributional data for Italian Syrphidae</li>
      <li>High-quality images and identification tools</li>
      <li>Ecological and behavioral information</li>
      <li>Links to curated literature and online resources</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      The success of this project depends on the collaboration of specialists, enthusiasts, and institutions. We warmly invite entomologists, naturalists, students, and citizen scientists to contribute data, images, expertise, or feedback.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-medium">
      If you're passionate about hoverflies and would like to be involved, please don’t hesitate to <a href="#contact" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">get in touch</a> — we would love to hear from you!
