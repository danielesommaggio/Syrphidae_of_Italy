      <strong>The Syrphidae of Italy (SoI)</strong> is a collaborative, open-access virtual space created to address the many gaps in our knowledge of hoverflies (family <em>Syrphidae</em>) within the Italian territory. Hoverflies play crucial ecological roles as pollinators, aphid predators, and bioindicators, yet their diversity and distribution in Italy remain poorly documented.

    <p class="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg">
      This project aims to centralize information, facilitate research, and foster community participation. We gather data from field observations, museum collections, taxonomic literature, and citizen science contributions to build a comprehensive and dynamic resource.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg">
      Our goal is to create a living, evolving repository that includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-5 text-gray-700 space-y-1 text-base sm:text-lg">
      <li>Taxonomic and distributional data for Italian Syrphidae</li>
      <li>High-quality images and identification tools</li>
      <li>Ecological and behavioral information</li>
      <li>Links to curated literature and online resources</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg">
      The success of this project depends on the collaboration of specialists, enthusiasts, and institutions. We warmly invite entomologists, naturalists, students, and citizen scientists to contribute data, images, expertise, or feedback.
    </p>
