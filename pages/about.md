# {{frontmatter.title}}
The Syrphidae of Italy (SoI) is a virtual space developed to try to fill the many gaps relating to the knowledge of hoverflies in Italy. The collaboration of multiple actors is fundamental for the realization of this project and for this reason we hope that the team will soon be able to expand.

## The Species File Group (SFG)
The WID is made possible by the technical and intellectual help from the [Species File Group (SFG)](https://speciesfilegroup.org/index.html), which is an endowment-funded collective of specialists whose broader goal is the advancement of biodiversity informatics. We are located at the University of Illinois, Illinois Natural History Survey. Our group supports the following software/activities:
- [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks.org) - a workbench for taxonomists and natural history museums.
- [Global Names Architecture](https://globalnames.org/) - finding, parsing, and resolving taxon names from literature. Lead Developer: Dmitry Mozzherin.
- [Catalogue of Life](https://catalogueoflife.org/) - editorial group, and data assembly hub. Executive Editor Yury Roskov and Database Manager Geoff Ower.
- Taxonomic/Systematic Research supporting several insect groups.
